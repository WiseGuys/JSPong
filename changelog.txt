Just want to keep track of any changes I make here

JSPong v1.2:
	Implemented gamestates
		Loading
		Main Menu
		Setting up/resetting
		Playing
		Gameover
	Fixed some little bugs
	Line count: 336

JSPong v1.1:
	Made it so paddles can't exit canvas
	Set the starting velocity of the ball to be randomized
	Also, made it so winner takes it
	Got rid of some magic numbers (height and width)
	Players now should start in the center
	Adjusted some things
	Made it harder by making the paddles smaller
	Acceleration after hitting paddles is now higher
	Changed around the physics - ball y velocity is now dependent on where it hits the paddle
		I'll tweak this down the road
	Upped the player speed a bit to account for increased difficulty
	Also added a limit on y velocity so it's not ridiculous
	Line count: 229

JSPong v1:
	Initial Release
	Line count: 207
