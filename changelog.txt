JSPong v1.3:
	Since this ended up being so big, I changed it to 1.3
	Tweaked collision settings
	index.html - added onclick event
	Added button object
	Added more menu functionality

		Multiple pages!
		Way too much time spent!
		Gazillions of lines of code!
		As in more than the game!
		Should probably work on that later!

JSPong v1.1:
	Made it so paddles can't exit canvas
	Set the starting velocity of the ball to be randomized
	Also, made it so winner takes it
	Got rid of some magic numbers (height and width)
	Players now should start in the center
	Adjusted some things
	Made it harder by making the paddles smaller
	Acceleration after hitting paddles is now higher
	Changed around the physics - ball y velocity is now dependent on where it hits the paddle
		I'll tweak this down the road
	Upped the player speed a bit to account for increased difficulty
	Also added a limit on y velocity so it's not ridiculous
